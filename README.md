# MindMedVR

## A dynamic guided meditation experience using real-time feedback from your brain

### Our purpose
Using EEG electrodes the MindMedVR app can process electrical waves from your brain to determine how stressed you are. Using more heavily guided miditation when your brain is stressed, MindMedVR aims to effectively calm down highly stressed doctors and nurses working in highly stressful environments before they perform major operations. As a result, their overall mental health and their ability to perform medical operations will improve significantly.

This repository is a fork of the hackathon team project, from natHacks 2024. In this project, my role was primarily centered around 3D UI design, creating and organizing the scenes in Unity, and contributing to overall project direction.
